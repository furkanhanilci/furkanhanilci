Throughout my academic journey at Uludağ University's Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I immersed myself in a world where innovation and technology converge. I gained invaluable hands-on experience in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Computer Science, and Autonomous Systems. My relentless passion for innovation drove me to contribute to numerous projects, each meticulously designed and executed with cutting-edge technology, showcasing both my technical proficiency and creative intelligence.

I had the privilege of leading the software team for a group competing in the Combat UAV category at Teknofest 2023, a defining moment that highlighted the power of teamwork and innovation. Following this, I embarked on a transformative journey as a Long-Term R&D Autonomous Driving Software Engineer at KARSAN Automotive. This role allowed me to delve deeper into the fascinating realm of autonomous systems, refining my engineering skills and broadening my understanding of real-world applications.

Currently, as an Autonomous Driving Software Engineer at KARSAN Automotive, I am dedicated to developing advanced planning and control software for autonomous vehicles. Additionally, I am deeply involved in the field of artificial intelligence, applying AI techniques to enhance the performance and capabilities of robotic and autonomous systems. This dual focus enables me to stand at the forefront of technological advancement, driving the future of science and technology forward.

Inspired by the belief that true progress involves pushing the boundaries of what we believe to be possible, I am continually propelled to seek new frontiers in technology and innovation. The essence of success lies not just in knowledge but in the imagination and creativity we bring to solving complex problems. This philosophy fuels my journey, inspiring me to innovate relentlessly and approach every challenge with a fresh perspective.
